# kzg
KZG (Kate, Zaverucha, Goldberg) polynomial commitment is a classic and efficient construction of polynomial commitment, and it is a fundamental component especially in the PLONK protocol. The following introduces its process and principles:
* Process
1. Trust Setup Phase:
    * Select public parameters, such as a prime number p and g associated with an elliptic curve.
    * Use a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ceremony to generate parameters. During this process, a random number s is determined, and $g,g^s,g^{s^2},...$ are computed. After generation, s is discarded and kept as a secret value. These parameters are subsequently used in the commitment and verification processes.
2. Commitment and Proof Creation Phase:
* Commitment Generation: The prover has a polynomial, say an n -degree polynomial P(x). Using the parameters obtained from the trust setup, through specific computations, a commitment C for the polynomial P(x) (where C is a point on the elliptic curve) is obtained and sent to the verifier.
* Proof Generation: The verifier sends a random value r to the prover. The prover computes the evaluation value P(r) of the polynomial P(x) at the point r. Meanwhile, based on principles such as the polynomial remainder theorem, the prover computes and generates relevant proof data (involving the commitment of another polynomial Q(x) under corresponding parameters, etc.) and sends them all to the verifier.
3. Commitment + Proof Verification Phase: The verifier uses bilinear-pairing technology. Based on the received commitment C, evaluation value P(r), and relevant proof data, through a series of operations and equality verifications of points on the elliptic curve, the verifier determines whether the information provided by the prover satisfies the relevant constraints of the polynomial, thereby verifying the correctness of the commitment and the proof.

Principles
* Based on Bilinear Pairing and Elliptic Curves: KZG polynomial commitment relies on the cryptographic tool of bilinear pairing. Bilinear pairing can map two pairs of elements in a multiplicative cyclic group to a target group, and it can be used to verify the multiplicative relationships among elements in the multiplicative cyclic group. Elliptic curves generate groups over finite fields, and the elements of the group (points on the elliptic curve) are used to represent polynomial - related commitments and computations. Safe cryptographic operations are achieved by leveraging the properties of elliptic curves.
* Schwartz - Zippel Lemma: This lemma is an important theoretical basis for the security of KZG polynomial commitment. Simply put, for a non - zero polynomial P(x), the probability of randomly selecting a point a in a finite field such that P(a)=0 is extremely low. During the KZG commitment verification process, the verifier uses random challenges (selecting random numbers as challenge values) to ensure that it is very difficult for the prover to cheat. If the prover can pass the verification, it is highly likely that the polynomial it provides meets the requirements.
* Polynomial Remainder Theorem: It plays a crucial role in the verification process. When the verifier gives a random value r, according to the polynomial remainder theorem, the prover computes the quotient polynomial Q(x) of P(x)−P(r) divided by x−r and sends the commitment related to Q(x) to the verifier. The verifier uses this information, combined with bilinear pairing and elliptic curve operations, to verify whether the equality holds, and thereby determines the validity of the polynomial commitment.

1. Polynomial Representation and Preprocessing
* Coefficient Form: Convert each Blob of data into the coefficient form of a polynomial. For example, $p(x)=\sum_{i = 0}^{d}p_{i}x^{i}$.
* Interpolation and Evaluation: Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the polynomial from coefficient form to point-value form, accelerating multiplication operations.
2. Efficient Algorithms for Polynomial Multiplication
* Karatsuba Algorithm: In go-kzg-4844, polynomial multiplication adopts the Karatsuba divide-and-conquer method, optimizing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^{1.585} )$. For instance, decompose the polynomial into high-order and low-order parts, recursively calculate sub-problems, then combine results.
* FFT Optimization: Combined with FFT, it further reduces the complexity of polynomial multiplication to O(nlogn), especially suitable for high-degree polynomials.
3. Commitment Generation and Aggregation
* Single Commitment Generation: Convert each Blob into a point $C_i=p_i(g)$ on the elliptic curve via the BlobToCommitment function.
* Aggregation Operations:
    * Linear Combination: Accumulate multiple commitments $C_i$​ by coefficients to generate an aggregated commitment $C_agg=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i​⋅C_i$​.
    * Recursive Merging: For large-scale data, use the multiexp algorithm to batch-calculate scalar multiplications of multiple points, enhancing aggregation efficiency.
4. Verification and Correctness Proof
    * Verification Logic: The verifier checks the correctness of the aggregated commitment through pairing operations. For example, verify $e(C_agg,h)=e(g,\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i​⋅p_i(a))$.
    * Recursive Proof Support: Combined with zero-knowledge protocols like PLONK or Halo2, embed the verification process of the aggregated commitment into off-chain calculations—only requiring concise proof submission on the chain.
