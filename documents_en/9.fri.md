FRI (Fast Reed - Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity) Implementation Principle for Low-Degree Polynomials
1. Objectives and Core Idea
The primary goal of FRI is to efficiently prove that a polynomial has a low degree—specifically, enabling the Verifier to confirm, through a small number of queries, that the degree of the polynomial committed by the Prover does not exceed a given value d. Its core ideas are as follows:
    * Recursive Folding: Split the original polynomial into progressively smaller sub-polynomials, halving the polynomial’s degree with each fold.
    * Random Challenges: The Verifier randomly selects points and requests the Prover to provide the polynomial’s values at these points to test if the polynomial meets the low-degree condition.
    * Merkle Tree Commitment: Utilizes a Merkle tree to commit to polynomial values, ensuring data integrity during verification.
        * Key Terms:
        * Low-Degree Polynomial: A polynomial whose highest exponent (degree) is bounded by a small value d.
        * Recursive Folding: A process that reduces the polynomial’s degree by recursively combining pairs of coefficients.
        * Merkle Tree: A cryptographic structure used to verify data consistency through hashed commitments.
2. Key Steps
* Commit Phase
    * Polynomial Decomposition: Split the original polynomial $f_0$ into two sub-polynomials $f_even$ and $f_odd$ according to even and odd indices.
    * Mix Operation: Use the random number $r_i$ to linearly combine these two sub-polynomials, obtaining a new polynomial $f_i+1(x)=f_even(x)+r_i⋅x⋅f_odd(x)$. After this operation, the degree of the new polynomial will be halved.
    * Recursive Folding: Continuously repeat the above decomposition and mixing steps until a polynomial with a sufficiently low degree (for example, 1) is obtained.
    * Merkle Tree Commitment: Construct a Merkle tree for the polynomial values generated in each round, and send the Merkle root as the commitment of this polynomial to the verifier.
* Query Phase
    * Random Challenge Point Selection: The verifier randomly selects some points from the polynomial in each round, and requires the prover to provide the polynomial values at these points.
    * Verify Consistency: The verifier needs to check the following two aspects: 
        * Whether the polynomial values in adjacent rounds remain consistent after the folding operation.
        * Whether the final low-degree polynomial is indeed linear (for example, whether it satisfies $f_k(x)=a+b⋅x$.

3. Mathematical Principles of Low-Degree Testing
    * Properties of Reed - Solomon Codes
        * FRI utilizes the error - correcting capability of Reed - Solomon codes. If the degree of the original polynomial f(x) is d, then its values at at least d+1 points can uniquely determine the polynomial. The verifier ensures through random sampling that it is difficult for a cheating prover to construct a high - degree polynomial that can pass all challenge points.
    * Challenge Strategy
        * Blow - up Factor: The number of challenge points in each round is related to the current degree of the polynomial, usually taking 4 times the degree. This can ensure a relatively high probability (about 3/4) of detecting cheating behavior.
        * Exponential Degree Reduction: After k rounds of folding, the degree of the polynomial will decrease from d to  $d/2^k$. When $ k=log_2 d $, the degree of the polynomial will drop to 1. At this time, only two points need to be verified to confirm its linear relationship.

4. Protocol Optimization and Variants
* Batching
    * Affine Batching: Compress multiple polynomials into one through linear combination. For example, $g_batched=g_0+r_1g_1+...+r_ng_n$, as adopted by StarkWare’s ethSTARK.
    * Parametric Batching: Use different powers of the same random number to compress polynomials. For example, $g_batched=g_0+r^1g_1+...+r^ng_n$, as used by RISC Zero and Polygon Hermez.
* Basefold Protocol
    * The Basefold protocol extends FRI to the multilinear polynomial commitment domain. By optimizing the folding process, it reduces the communication overhead to about 1/3 of the original scheme, while the increase in computational overhead is less than 3%
