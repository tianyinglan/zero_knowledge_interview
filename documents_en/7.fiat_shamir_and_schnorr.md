# the difference between fait_shamir and schnorr
Schnorr Protocol's Interactive Nature
The Schnorr protocol consists of three steps: commitment, challenge, and response:
1. Commitment: The prover generates a random number r, computes R=rG (where G is the elliptic curve generator), and sends R to the verifier.
2. Challenge: The verifier generates a random challenge c and sends it to the prover.
3. Response: The prover calculates s=r+c.x (where x is the private key) and sends s to the verifier. The verifier checks if s.G=R+c.X (where X is the public key).
* Key Constraint: The verifier must generate the challenge c in real time, requiring live interaction between the prover and verifier. This makes the Schnorr protocol inherently interactive.

Non-Interactive Fiat-Shamir Transformation
the Fiat-Shamir heuristic converts interactive protocols into non-interactive ones by replacing the verifier’s challenge generation with a hash function:
1. Hash Function Substitution: The prover inputs the message m, commitment R, and public key X into a hash function to generate the challenge c=H(m,R,X).
2. Autonomous Proof Generation: The prover computes s=r+c⋅x and sends (R,s) as the proof.
3. Offline Verification: The verifier recomputes c=H(m,R,X) and checks s⋅G=R+c⋅X, eliminating the need for real-time participation.
* Critical Role of Hash Function: The hash function acts as a random oracle, ensuring the challenge c is indistinguishable from a truly random value, thus preserving security properties.

### Summary
The Schnorr protocol requires live interaction for challenge generation, while the Fiat-Shamir transformation uses a hash function to automate this step, enabling non-interactive proofs. The security of the Fiat-Shamir approach relies on the hash function’s collision resistance and the random oracle assumption.

# fait_shamir
The Fiat-Shamir transform eliminates the need for interaction by replacing the step where the verifier sends challenges to the prover during the interaction with generating challenges via a hash function, converting the proof protocol into a non-interactive one.

1. Commitment: The prover sends a commitment to the verifier. This commitment is an obfuscated representation of secret knowledge—revealing no specific content but enabling subsequent verification.
2. Challenge: The verifier generates and sends a random challenge to the prover.
3. Response: The prover creates a response based on the challenge and their secret knowledge, then sends it to the verifier.
4. Verification: The verifier uses the commitment, challenge, and response with a verification algorithm to check if the prover truly holds the corresponding knowledge.

Sudoku

1. Assertion Setting: E.g., "I know the solution to a Sudoku puzzle".
2. Encrypted Commitment: Convert the solution into an encrypted form (like a hash value).
3. Random Challenge: The verifier selects rows, columns, or blocks for verification.
4. Local Verification: The prover provides decrypted data for the corresponding area; the verifier checks its integrity.

Repeated Verification: Reduce fraud probability through multiple challenges.

### Schnorr Signature's Original Interactive Protocol  
- **Commitment**: The prover selects a random number $k$, calculates $R = g^k$ (where $g$ is the group generator), and sends $R$ to the verifier.  
- **Challenge**: The verifier selects a random number $c$ and sends it to the prover.  
- **Response**: The prover calculates $s = k + cx$ (where $x$ is the private key), and sends $s$ to the verifier.  
- **Verification**: The verifier checks $g^s = R \cdot y^c$ (where $y = g^x$ is the public key).  

### Schnorr Signature's Fiat - Shamir Transformation  
- **Commitment**: The prover selects a random number $k$, calculates $R = g^k$.  
- **Challenge**: Uses a hash function to generate the challenge $c = H(R, M)$, where $M$ can be the message to be signed or other public information.  
- **Response**: The prover calculates $s = k + cx$.  
- **Signature**: The signature is $(R, s)$.  
- **Verification**: The verifier checks $g^s = R \cdot y^{H(R, M)}$.
