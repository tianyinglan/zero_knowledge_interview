# GKR
GKR is a zero-knowledge proof system based on the Generalized Reed - Solomon Code. The Generalized Reed - Solomon Code, an error-correcting code, has important applications in coding theory. The core goal of GKR is to allow the verifier to verify whether the circuit calculation result claimed by the prover is correct without directly computing the outputs of all gates in the arithmetic circuit. It can complete the verification with relatively low complexity, especially suitable for large-scale circuits.
## Circuit Representation and Multilinear Extension
* Circuit Representation: Regard the arithmetic circuit to be verified as a Boolean circuit or arithmetic circuit, which includes input gates, intermediate gates, and output gates. Each gate performs specific arithmetic operations (such as addition and multiplication).
* Multilinear Extension: For each gate in the circuit, treat its input and output as functions of variables, and extend these functions to a larger domain through multilinear extension. Multilinear extension is a technique to extend Boolean functions or arithmetic functions to a finite field. It can extend functions originally defined only on Boolean values to all elements in the finite field, enabling the functions to have better mathematical properties, facilitating subsequent verification operations.
## Interactive Verification Process
* The interactive verification process of GKR is mainly divided into the following stages:
    * Commitment Stage: The prover commits to the multilinear extension of each gate in the circuit. The commitment is usually done by using a hash function or other cryptographic commitment schemes to encrypt the relevant information of the multilinear extension, and then sending the commitment to the verifier. The purpose of this is to ensure that the prover cannot arbitrarily change this information in the subsequent verification process.
    * Challenge Stage: The verifier randomly selects some points and requires the prover to provide the function values of these points under the multilinear extension. The selection of these random points is to ensure that the verifier can detect whether the prover cheats with a relatively high probability.
    * Verification Stage: According to the function values provided by the prover, combined with the structure and operation rules of the circuit, the verifier checks whether these values meet the constraint conditions of the circuit. Specifically, the verifier will check whether the input and output of each gate conform to the corresponding arithmetic operation relationship at these random points. If all checks pass, the verifier will accept the prover's proof and consider the circuit's calculation result to be correct.
## Recursive Verification
GKR adopts a recursive method for verification, decomposing the verification problem of a large-scale circuit into the verification problems of multiple small-scale circuits. The specific approach is to divide the circuit into multiple sub-circuits according to certain rules, and then verify each sub-circuit independently. When verifying the sub-circuits, the above commitment, challenge, and verification steps are also used. By continuously reducing the scale of verification in a recursive manner, the verification of the entire circuit can be efficiently completed eventually.
