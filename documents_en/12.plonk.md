### Theoretical Foundations
Permutations: PLONK uses permutations to organize and process data in a specific way. It can change the order of elements without compromising the security and integrity of the proof.

Lagrange bases: They are used to represent polynomials efficiently. In PLONK, Lagrange bases help create polynomials that capture the relationships between different parts of the circuit.

Oecumenical noninteractive arguments of knowledge: This means that the protocol can be universally applied to different scenarios. It allows the prover to make the verifier believe that a certain statement is true without the need for direct interaction between the prover and the verifier.
### Key Steps
* Circuit Construction: Transform the problem that needs to be proven into an arithmetic circuit. The circuit is composed of gates (such as multiplication gates and addition gates) and wires, which describe the mathematical calculation process. For example, if you want to prove that a certain mathematical equation holds, you can construct the calculation processes on both sides of the equation as a circuit.
* Constraint Generation:
    * Gate Constraints: For each gate in the circuit, generate corresponding constraint conditions to ensure the correctness of the logical relationship between the input and output of the gate. For example, for a multiplication gate with inputs $x_1$、$x_2$ and output y, the gate constraint is $x_1×x_2=y$.
    * Copy Constraints: They are used to ensure that the wires at different positions in the circuit have the same value, which can be achieved through the "method of coordinate pair accumulators".
* Polynomial Representation: Represent the linear system as a polynomial. Transform the constraint conditions in the circuit into polynomial equations, so that the verification of the circuit constraints is transformed into the verification of the polynomial equations.
* Polynomial Commitment: The prover uses a polynomial commitment scheme (such as the KZG scheme) to commit to the polynomial. This commitment is equivalent to an encrypted guarantee of the polynomial content without revealing the specific polynomial. The verifier can verify the correctness of the polynomial by sending a random point to the prover and asking the prover to "open" the commitment at that point.
* Proof Generation: Based on the polynomials and commitments generated in the above steps, the prover calculates a proof. This proof can prove that the prover knows the solution that satisfies the circuit constraints without revealing the original information.
* Proof Verification: The verifier receives the proof sent by the prover and the polynomial commitment. By verifying the validity of the proof at a random point, the verifier can determine whether the solution provided by the prover satisfies the circuit constraints of the original problem, thereby determining the authenticity of the proof.

Through the above principles, the PLONK protocol provides an efficient and secure zero-knowledge proof solution, which can be widely applied to fields such as privacy transactions in blockchains and data sharing verification.

# SHPLONK 
SHPLONK is an efficient polynomial commitment scheme. As an extended version of the KZG10 scheme, it implements a Batch Polynomial Commitment Scheme. The main role of SHPLONK is to use a single group element to prove the evaluations of multiple polynomials on specific point sets, instead of making commitments for each polynomial separately, thus significantly improving efficiency.
* Basic Principles
    * SHPLONK ensures the correct evaluation of f(X) on each point set S by constructing the polynomial r(X), and verifies the polynomial’s correctness through pairing operations. Specifically, SHPLONK allows each polynomial to have its own "evaluation set"—meaning each polynomial can be evaluated on different point sets—while the verifier only needs one group element to verify the correctness of all polynomials.
* Application Scenarios and Advantages
    * The core advantage of SHPLONK lies in its efficiency. Traditional polynomial commitment schemes require multiple pairing operations when dealing with multiple polynomials and points. SHPLONK, however, reduces computational complexity significantly via batch processing. This makes it particularly valuable in scenarios demanding a large number of polynomial commitments.
