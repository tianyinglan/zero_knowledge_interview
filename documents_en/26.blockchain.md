### Core Concepts
1. Key Features of Blockchain
    * Decentralization, immutability, consensus mechanism, smart contracts, distributed ledger.
    * Extended Question: What’s the difference between "decentralization" and "distribution"? (Distribution refers to physical node dispersion; decentralization refers to control authority dispersion.)
2. Consensus Mechanism Comparison

| Mechanism    | Representative Project   | Core Principle                | Advantages & Disadvantages                                |
|---------|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| PoW     | Bitcoin     | Computational power competition for block creation        | Secure but energy-intensive                        |
| PoS     | Ethereum 2.0 | Staked token validation for block verification        | Efficient but vulnerable to "nothing-at-stake" attacks          |
| DPoS    | EOS        | Delegated voting for node validation        | High throughput but centralization risks                |
| PBFT    | Hyperledger   | Majority consensus among nodes          | Low latency, suitable for consortium chains   
			
	
3. Smart Contracts
    * Definition: Self-executing code protocols deployed on blockchains.
    * Common Vulnerabilities: Reentrancy attacks (e.g., DAO incident), integer overflow, flawed access control.
    * Security Practices: Use OpenZeppelin libraries, formal verification, code audits.

4. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum
    * Bitcoin: Payment-focused, UTXO model, PoW consensus.
    * Ethereum: Smart contract-enabled, account model, transitioning to PoS.
    * Extended Question: Why does Ethereum need the Gas mechanism? (Prevent resource abuse.)

* Technical Depth
1. Blockchain Scaling Solutions
    * On-chain Scaling: Bitcoin SegWit (Segregated Witness), Ethereum Sharding.
    * Off-chain Scaling: Lightning Network (Bitcoin), Polygon (Ethereum Layer 2).
    * Cross-chain Technology: Polkadot parachains, Cosmos IBC protocol.
2. Cryptography
    * Hash Functions: SHA-256 (Bitcoin), Keccak-256 (Ethereum).
    * Digital Signatures: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature), BLS signatures (aggregated signatures).
    * Zero-Knowledge Proofs: zk-SNARKs (Zcash), zk-STARKs (zkSync).
3. Wallets & Private Key Management
    * Types: Hot wallets (online), cold wallets (offline), hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger).
    * Backup Mechanisms: Mnemonics (BIP-39), multisignature (Multisig).
    * Post-Quantum Security: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), e.g., lattice-based algorithms.
4. DApp Development
    * Frameworks: Truffle, Hardhat, Foundry.
    * Frontend Interaction: Web3.js, ethers.js.
    * Storage: IPFS (distributed storage), Arweave (permanent storage).

## Security & Compliance
1. Common Attacks
    * 51% Attack: Controlling >50% of network hash power to rewrite history (e.g., Bitcoin Cash 2018 incident).
    * Flash Loan Attack: Exploiting DeFi protocol vulnerabilities for arbitrage (e.g., Wintermute’s $160M loss in 2022).
    * Oracle Attack: Manipulating external data inputs (e.g., bZx price manipulation in 2020).
2. Regulatory Requirements
    * KYC/AML: Identity verification, anti-money laundering monitoring.
    * Data Privacy: GDPR, CCPA implications for on-chain data.
    * Regulatory Trends: SEC’s stance on security tokens, EU’s MiCA Act.
3. Quantum Resistance
    * Threat: Shor’s algorithm breaks RSA/ECC encryption.
    * Solutions: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).
## Cutting-Edge Trends (2025)
1. Layer 2 Explosion
    * Rollups: Optimistic Rollup (Arbitrum), zk-Rollup (StarkNet).
    * State Channels: For high-frequency transactions (e.g., Raiden Network).
2. Cross-chain Interoperability
    * Polkadot Ecosystem: Parachain asset transfers (e.g., Kusama).
    * Cosmos Ecosystem: IBC protocol enabling cross-chain communication (e.g., Osmosis).
3. DeFi + AI Integration
    * AI Oracles: Real-time data aggregation (e.g., API3 x Chainlink).
    * Algorithmic Stablecoins: AI-driven rate adjustments (e.g., FRAX V3).
4. NFT Innovations
    * GameFi Assets: Axie Infinity’s SLP token economy.
    * Metaverse Identity: Decentraland’s LAND NFT ownership.
5. Regulatory Developments
    * Stablecoin Regulation: U.S. Stablecoin Bill impact on USDT/USDC.
    * DAO Governance: SEC scrutiny of Uniswap DAO.
### Scenario-Based Questions
1. Designing a Decentralized Lending Protocol
    * Considerations: Over-collateralization, liquidation mechanisms, flash loan prevention, oracle security.
    * Reference: Aave V3’s isolation mode and safety modules.
2. Blockchain in Supply Chains
    * Traceability: IBM Food Trust’s distributed ledger approach.
    * Challenges: Data privacy, node incentives, cross-enterprise collaboration.
3. Quantum Computing Mitigation
    * Migration Path: Transitioning to NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms.
    * Interim Strategy: Hybrid encryption (classical + PQC).
