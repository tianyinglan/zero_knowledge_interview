PCS (Polynomial commitment schemes)
1. One open point: 
If f(x)−a is divisible by x−z, it demonstrates that f(z)=a.
2. Multi open points: 
For the set $S^+$, there exists a polynomial $Z_S(X) = \prod_{z \in S} (X - z)$. If f(X)−r(X) is divisible by the polynomial $Z_s(X)$, it means that for any element z in the set S, f(z)=r(z) holds.
3. PCS protocol : A polynomial commitment scheme should be composed of three parts, Θ=(gen,com,open), satisfying:
    1. gen(d) – outputs the SRS (structured reference string).
    2. com(f,srs)– the commitment algorithm. Given the polynomial $f \in F_{<d} [X]$ and the SRS, it calculates the commitment cm for the polynomial f.
    3. open– a public coin protocol between the Prover and the Verifier.

## Polynomial Commitment Process  

### Commitment Generation  
- The prover possesses a polynomial  P(X). When using KZG, the prover converts the polynomial  P(X) into a set of points on an elliptic curve based on elements in the CRS (Common Reference String) or SRS (Structured Reference String).  
- The prover commits the polynomial  P(X)  to the elliptic curve group by computing $[P(\tau)]_1$ and $[P(\tau)]_2$ (where $\tau$ is a secret element in the CRS or SRS). These two elements are generally referred to as the polynomial commitment.  

### Proof Generation  
- For proving the value $P(z)$ of the polynomial $P(X)$ at a specific point $z$, the prover calculates the quotient polynomial $Q(X) = \frac{P(X) - P(z)}{X - z}$.  
- The prover generates the proof $\pi$, which represents $Q(\tau)$ on the elliptic curve. This proof is concise, typically containing only one or several elements of the elliptic curve group.  

### Proof Verification  
- The verifier uses the commitment $[P(\tau)]_1$, $[P(\tau)]_2$, the proof $\pi$, and the point $z$ and $P(z)$.  
- The verifier leverages the pairing operation of the elliptic curve and elements in the CRS or SRS to check whether the equation $e\left([P(\tau)]_1 - [P(z)]_1, g_2\right) = e\left(\pi, [\tau - z]_2\right)$ holds (where $e$ is the pairing function of the elliptic curve, and $g_2$ is the generator of the elliptic curve group). If the equation holds, the verification succeeds.  





### summary
The core of PCS is to generate a commitment. Through this commitment, the prover convinces the verifier of the existence of a certain polynomial. Common PCSs include KZG, BLS, etc., which are based on elliptic curve pairing.

Six Core Steps of Polynomial Commitment Scheme
1. Initialization (Setup): Generate essential parameters required for computing polynomial commitments.
2. Commit: Calculate the polynomial commitment, resulting in a single value.
3. Open: Disclose the polynomial function corresponding to the polynomial commitment.
4. VerifyPoly: Validate whether the polynomial commitment matches the polynomial function.
5. CreateWitness: Prove whether the value of the polynomial function at a specific point matches the claimed value by prover P. The mathematical method involves checking divisibility: polynomial(x)mod(x−a)=claimed value
6. VerifyEval: Verifier V uses bilinear pairing to verify whether the polynomial function’s value at a specific point matches the claimed value by prover P. The mathematical approach involves verifying multiplicative relationships via bilinear pairing.
* Key Term Explanations
    * Bilinear Pairing: A cryptographic tool that maps operations between two groups to a third group, enabling efficient non-interactive verification.
    * Witness: Intermediate data generated during the proof process, supporting verifiers to quickly confirm computational correctness.
    * Polynomial Commitment: A cryptographic method to commit to a polynomial, allowing subsequent verification of its properties without revealing the polynomial itself.
This scheme is widely applied in zero-knowledge proof systems (e.g., zk-SNARK, Halo2), ensuring efficient verification of complex computations while preserving data privacy.



# piop
* Initialization:
    * Suppose we have a polynomial f(x) (a univariate polynomial, starting with a simple case for easier understanding) defined over a finite field F, and we need to prove that $ \sum_{x \in S} f(x)=V$, where S is a subset of the finite field F, and V is a claimed summation value. 
    * The prover knows the coefficients of the polynomial f(x), and the verifier knows the set S and the claimed value V.
* First-round Interaction:
    * The prover expresses the polynomial f(x) as $f(x)=a_0​+a_1x + a_2x^2 +  \cdots + a_dx^d$ (where d is the degree of the polynomial). Then, if it is a multivariate polynomial, a new polynomial$g_1(x)=\sum_{x \in S - \{x\}} f(x,y)$ is calculated. For simplification, consider the univariate polynomial case here, where $g_1(x)=f(x)$. Next, the prover sends the coefficients of $g_1(x)$ to the verifier. The verifier randomly selects an element $r_1 \in F$ and asks the prover to provide the value of $g_1(r_1)$.
* Subsequent-round Interaction:
    * The prover calculates a new polynomial $g_2(x)$, which is constructed based on $g_1(x)$ and the previously selected random element $r_1$, ensuring that the summation property of $g_2(x)$ is related to $g_1(x)$. For example, under an appropriate transformation, $g_2(x)$ might represent the summation of $g_1(x)$ over a reduced set. Then, the prover sends the coefficients of$g_2(x)$ to the verifier. The verifier randomly selects another element $r_2 \in F$ and asks the prover to provide the value of $g_2(r_2)$. This process continues for d (the degree of the polynomial) rounds of interaction.
* Final Verification:
    * In the last round, the verifier can check whether a certain equation relationship is satisfied based on the previously received information and the last value provided by the prover, so as to determine whether the prover’s claim is correct. If all checks pass, the verifier accepts the prover’s proof.

# iop and piop
IOP is a general interactive proof protocol, while PIOP is specifically designed for polynomial-related verification. In PIOP, through multiple rounds of interaction, the verifier randomly selects points and asks the prover to provide the values of the polynomial at these points, thereby verifying whether the polynomial meets the conditions such as low degree.
* Core Functions of PIOP
    * Recursive Verification: Decompose high-degree polynomials into low-degree sub - polynomials and conduct challenges round by round.
    * Low - Degree Test: Utilize the error - correction ability of Reed - Solomon codes to ensure that the degree of the polynomial is below the threshold.
* Technical Principles of PIOP
    * Random Challenge: The verifier selects a point z and asks the prover to provide f(z) and its derivative f’(z).
    * Multilinear Extension: Convert non - polynomial functions into polynomial forms for easy verification.
    * Number of Interaction Rounds: The number of rounds is proportional to the logarithm of the polynomial degree, and the verification complexity is O(logd).
* Typical Protocols of PIOP
    * SumCheck: Verify the correctness of polynomial summation by recursively fixing variables and conducting random challenges.
* Fast Reed - Solomon IOP of Proximity (FRI): Recursively fold polynomials and combine with Merkle tree commitments, supporting transparent setup.
