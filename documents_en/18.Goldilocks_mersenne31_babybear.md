# Goldilocks
Goldilocks is a finite field, and the characteristic of this field (that is, the minimum number of additions required for elements in the field to reach the zero element) is $p=2^{64}âˆ’2^{32}+1$. A finite field is an algebraic structure. When addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (zero cannot be the divisor) operations are carried out in this structure, the results still remain within the field. For example, the common finite field formed by integer modular p operations, and in the Goldilocks finite field, calculations are also carried out based on similar modular operation rules.
* Fast operation speed: Since it is adapted to 64-bit integers, it has a high degree of compatibility with modern CPU architectures. When performing operations based on this field, it can fully utilize the performance of the CPU. Compared with some finite fields that do not match the CPU architecture, it has obvious advantages in operation speed. For example, when a large number of in-field multiplication and addition operations are carried out in a zero-knowledge proof system, the results can be quickly obtained, improving the operation efficiency of the entire system.
* Avoid overflow problems: The multiplication of two 32-bit integers will not cause the problem of field modulo overflow. When performing numerical calculations, there is no need to spend additional resources and code to detect and handle overflow situations as in other finite fields. This not only simplifies the calculation logic but also reduces the risk of errors caused by improper overflow handling, enhancing the stability and reliability of the calculation.
* High verification efficiency: It can quickly check whether 4 16-bit values form a valid field element. In some scenarios where the validity of elements needs to be frequently verified, such as verifying whether input data is a legal field element in a cryptographic protocol, the verification operation can be quickly completed, saving time and computational resources, which is of great help in improving the response speed and processing capacity of the system.
* Good application adaptability: It has good applications in the fields of blockchain, zero-knowledge proof, etc. For example, it has been adopted in multiple projects in the Polygon ecosystem, providing efficient and stable finite field support for the computational tasks in these fields, helping to achieve the high performance and security of the relevant systems.

# Mersenne31
Characteristics:
* Based on Mersenne prime number: Mersenne31 is constructed based on the Mersenne prime number $2^31 - 1$. This prime number has special mathematical properties and can be used to define the size of the finite field in cryptography.
* Efficient operation: Due to its special form, for arithmetic operations on the finite field, such as addition, multiplication, and inversion, some optimized algorithms can be used to achieve relatively high computational efficiency.
* Advantages:
    * Good cryptographic security: The mathematical properties of Mersenne prime numbers make the cryptographic system based on Mersenne31 have good security, and it can effectively resist some common cryptographic analysis attacks, such as the discrete logarithm attack.
    * Friendly to hardware implementation: Its regular operation structure is convenient for hardware implementation and can be used to design efficient cryptographic chips, reducing the hardware cost and power consumption of the cryptographic system.
* Disadvantages:
    * Potential mathematical risks: Although the cryptographic system based on Mersenne prime numbers is currently considered secure, with the development of mathematical theory, new mathematical methods may emerge to crack the cryptographic system based on Mersenne31.
    * Poor compatibility with some protocols: The finite field structure of Mersenne31 has poor compatibility with some existing cryptographic protocols or standards. When applied to complex cryptographic systems, additional conversion and adaptation work may be required.

# Babybear
Characteristics:
* Suitable for lightweight applications: Babybear is a small field designed for lightweight cryptographic applications, and the characteristic of its field is $p=2^{31}-2^{27}+1$. Its parameter selection makes the resources required for cryptographic operations relatively small, and it is suitable for running on resource-constrained devices, such as Internet of Things devices, sensor nodes, etc.
* Based on elliptic curve cryptography: It is often combined with the elliptic curve cryptosystem and uses the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves to provide cryptographic security.
* Advantages:
    * Low resource consumption: It has low requirements in terms of memory, computing power, and power consumption, allowing resource-constrained devices to implement cryptographic protection without affecting the operation of their main functions.
    * Fast key generation: Based on its design features, the generation of elliptic curve key pairs is relatively fast, which can meet the application scenarios with requirements for key generation speed, such as real-time communication encryption.
* Disadvantages:
    * Insufficient security verification: As a relatively new small field, compared with some classic cryptographic systems, its security has been less verified in practice and has less time-tested experience, and there may be some security vulnerabilities that have not been discovered yet.
    * Lack of industry standards: Currently, Babybear has not been widely adopted as an industry standard, which may cause difficulties in interoperability between different devices and systems and limit its application in large-scale network environments.

# Comparison
1. High 2-adicity. The 2-adicity of the finite field $F_q$ is the largest power of 2 that can divide q - 1, and the latter is the order of its multiplicative group. Among the above prime numbers:
    * Goldilocks has the highest 2-adicity, which is  $2^{32}$ .
    * Exceptionally, for M31, only when it is extended to $F_{p^2_{M31}}$ and the circle group with an order of $p_{M31}+1$ is used can it reach a practical 2-adicity of $2^31$.
2. Modern computing architectures prefer prime numbers that are suitable for common word lengths (16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit) to achieve efficient arithmetic. Compared with the large prime numbers (usually between hundreds of bits) used in elliptic curve cryptography or RSA, small prime numbers significantly reduce the computational cost. Specifically:
    * Baby Bear is regarded as a 32-bit field.
    * And the circle group of M31 is also 32-bit.
    * While Goldilocks is a 64-bit field.
3. Modular reduction is the cornerstone of field arithmetic, and the efficiency of this operation varies significantly among different prime numbers.
    * M31 stands out for its unparalleled efficiency, and it only requires one addition to complete the modular reduction.
    * Goldilocks follows closely behind and benefits from the optimization using 24-bit limbs.
    * While the efficiency of Baby Bear varies depending on the implementation strategy.
