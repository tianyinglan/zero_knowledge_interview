# sumcheck
* Given a polynomial, the Sumcheck protocol allows the prover to prove to the verifier that the summation result of the polynomial over a given set (such as a hypercube set) is a specific value, without disclosing information like the coefficients of the polynomial itself.
* It helps reduce the requirement of evaluating and summing a multivariate polynomial to a single evaluation at a randomly chosen point.

1. Core Objective

SumCheck is a zero-knowledge proof protocol used to verify the correctness of polynomial summation. Its core objective is to allow the Verifier, through low-complexity verification steps, to confirm that the Prover has correctly calculated the sum of a certain polynomial over all binary inputs—without having to perform high-complexity calculations themselves.

2. Technical Principles

    * Recursive Decomposition
        * Decompose the summation problem of the multivariate polynomial f(x1,x2,…,xl) into l steps. At each step, fix one variable to a random value and recursively verify the summation of the polynomial with the remaining variables.
    * Random Challenge
        * In each round, the Verifier selects a random number ri​, requiring the Prover to provide the polynomial hi(xi+1,…,xl) after fixing the variable xi=ri​, and verify its correctness.
    * Low-Degree Extension (MLE)
        * Through Multilinear Extension, convert non-polynomial functions into polynomial forms—ensuring the SumCheck protocol applies to a broader range of scenarios.
3. Verification Process
    1. Initial Step: The Prover calculates and sends the total sum $S= \sum _{x_1​,…,x_l \in {0,1}}f(x_1,…,x_l)$.
    2. Challenge per Variable:
        1. The Verifier randomly selects $r_1∈F$, requiring the Prover to provide the sum $S_1$​ of $h_1(x_2,…,x_l)=f(r_1,x_2,…,x_l)$.
        2. Verifies $S=h_1(0)+h_1(1)$ and recursively verifies $S_1​$.
    3. Final Verification:
        * After l rounds of challenges, the problem simplifies to verifying the sum of the univariate polynomial $h_l(x_l)$, which the Verifier directly calculates and confirms.
4. Efficiency and Security
    * Complexity: The Verifier’s verification time is O(d⋅l) (d is the polynomial degree), far lower than the exponential complexity of direct calculation.
    * Zero Knowledge: The Verifier cannot obtain the specific form of the polynomial from the challenges, only confirming the correctness of the resul
