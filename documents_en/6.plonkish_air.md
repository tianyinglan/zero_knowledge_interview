PLONKish is the arithmetization method of the PLONK (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive Knowledge arguments) protocol. Its core is to decompose computations into a combination of permutation polynomials and linear constraints.
* Permutation Table Optimization: Through precomputed permutation tables (such as Merkle trees), complex operations are transformed into table lookup operations, reducing the number of constraints.
* Universal SRS (Common Reference String): A trusted setup generates universal parameters once, supporting multiplexing of multiple circuits and avoiding generating parameters separately for each circuit.
* Recursion-Friendly: Supports dynamic adjustment of the circuit structure, suitable for recursive proofs (such as nested verification).
* AIR is the arithmetization method of the ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) protocol. It encodes the computation process into polynomial constraints through matrix representation.
    * Matrix Structuring: Represents computation steps as rows of a matrix and variables as columns, verifying global consistency through polynomial interpolation and evaluation.
    * Transparent Setup: No trusted parameters are required. It relies on the collision resistance of hash functions, avoiding initialization trust risks.
* Recursive Extension: Supports infinite recursive proofs, suitable for handling large-scale computations (such as StarkNet's general ZK Rollup).
