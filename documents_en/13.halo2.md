# halo2

Halo 2 is based on the underlying algorithm and circuit construction paradigm of PLONK. It also extends custom gates and lookup (also known as UltraPLONK).

The way Halo 2 circuits are written differs from others (e.g., Bellman). It organizes and defines different attribute values using tables or matrices, which are structured as rectangular value matrices. Traditional terms like "rows," "columns," and "cells" are used to describe the matrix.

The circuit includes a series of configurations:
1. A finite field F, where cell values are elements of F. The Pasta curve field is used here.
2. Data is stored in tables with several column types:
    1. advice: Commonly referred to as the witness—the secret input in the circuit.
    2. instance: Serves as a public input (abbreviated as PI), a value known (or shared) by both the prover (P) and verifier (V).
    3. Fixed: Functions as a constant (equivalent to Qc​ in the PLONK paper) and is part of the circuit.
    4. Selector: Determines the type of gate. In Halo 2, it’s a special case of the Fixed column, only taking values 0 or 1.
3. Copy constraint: Applies to two or more different cells.
4. Lookup & polynomial constraints: Constraints can reference cell values in a given column of the current row or another row. That is, polynomial constraints in a gate can reference values across multiple rows and columns, offering flexible access.

How to construct tables (or matrices) in Halo 2

Take circuits as examples to illustrate how common R1CS or other PLONK circuits evolve into Halo 2 tables.

Technical Principles

* Arithmetization based on PLONK
    * Halo 2 is a zero-knowledge proof system built based on PLONK (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge). It uses PLONK’s arithmetization idea to represent computational problems as polynomial constraints defined over a finite field.
    * By leveraging polynomial commitments and polynomial properties, the prover can commit to polynomial calculation results and provide proofs. The verifier can verify the correctness of polynomial calculations without knowing specific computation details.
* Customized gates and lookup tables
    * Halo 2 provides highly flexible customized gates and lookup tables.
    * Customized gates allow developers to define their own gate logic to meet different computational needs. For example, developers can design specialized addition gates, multiplication gates, comparison gates, etc., enhancing system flexibility and adaptability.
    * Lookup tables store precomputed data, enabling the prover to reference it during proof generation—avoiding the need to include it in the polynomial, thus reducing polynomial complexity and computation.
* Recursive proof and instantiation
    * Supports recursive proof, allowing embedding one proof into another to construct complex proof chains. This is crucial for proving multiple computational steps or iterative computations.
    * Recursion compresses proof size and verification time, enabling proof verification within limited space and time, thus achieving scalability.

Steps
1. Construction of the arithmetic circuit
    * Convert computation into an arithmetic circuit: First, represent the computational task to be proven as an arithmetic circuit, connecting inputs, intermediate results, and outputs via gates and wires. For instance, represent a simple task as a series of gates (multiplication, addition, etc.) and wires (variables).
    * Define customized gates and lookup tables (optional): Optimize the circuit using Halo 2’s functions. Store data like predefined constants or mappings in lookup tables if applicable.
2. Generation of polynomial constraints
    * Use PLONK arithmetization to convert the arithmetic circuit into polynomial constraints. Each gate and wire is expressed as a polynomial constraint, transforming circuit computations into polynomial equalities.
3. Proof generation
    * The prover uses a polynomial commitment scheme to map polynomials to elliptic curve points.
    * Generate proof information based on computation results and commitments, including proof polynomial computation, commitments, and lookup table/customized gate details.
4. Proof verification
    * The verifier uses the prover’s proof information. Check proof correctness via elliptic curve cryptography operations (e.g., pairing) and verification algorithms, based on polynomial constraints and commitments.
    * For recursive proofs, the verifier recursively checks sub-proof correctness, ultimately verifying the entire proof chain.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages
* Flexibility and customizability
    * Customized gates and lookup tables let developers design 
    * circuits flexibly for specific tasks, meeting complex needs beyond standard gate types.

    * Supports recursive proof for building complex chains. Compresses proof size and verification time for multi-step or iterative computations, improving scalability.
* Performance and efficiency
    * Optimizes proof generation/verification for complex computations via flexible arithmetization and lookup tables, reducing proof size and verification time.
* Wide applicability
    * Applies to cryptographic scenarios like privacy protection, blockchain private transactions, and identity verification. Builds zero-knowledge proof protocols to safeguard user privacy and security.

Disadvantages

* Steep learning curve
    * Involves complex concepts (polynomials, elliptic curve cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs), challenging for developers. Requires in-depth understanding of arithmetization, polynomial constraints, etc.
* Reliance on trusted setup (in some versions)
    * Early versions/implementations may need trusted setup (e.g., CRS/SRS generation), introducing security risks. While multi-party computation can mitigate risks in some cases, extra computation/coordination is still needed.
* Complexity
    * Its powerful features and flexibility make implementation/use complex. Demands high technical skills for development, debugging, and maintenance, with potential errors/security risks—needing careful design.

Summary
* Halo 2 is a robust zero-knowledge proof system. Its PLONK-based arithmetization, customized gates, lookup tables, and recursive proof offer a flexible, efficient way to build/verify proofs. It has broad prospects in privacy protection, blockchains, etc. However, its complexity and technical requirements demand careful consideration and in-depth technical knowledge during use.
* Developers must study zero-knowledge proofs, polynomial constraints, elliptic curve cryptography, etc., to leverage its advantages and avoid risks. In different scenarios, evaluate its suitability based on needs/security requirements, and optimize accordingly.


# some prove system of halo2
1. Lookup Argument
* Technical Principle
    * Lookup argument is used to verify whether an element exists in a predefined set while hiding the set’s content. 
    * Halo2 proves the element’s existence by encoding the set as a polynomial and leveraging polynomial commitment schemes (such as FRI). The specific steps are as follows:
        1. Polynomial Encoding: Map the elements in the set to the coefficients of a polynomial. For example, encode the set {a, b, c} as the polynomial f(x) = a + b x + c x².
        2. Commitment Generation: The prover generates a commitment to the polynomial f(x) and sends it to the verifier.
        3. Challenge Verification: The verifier randomly selects a point x and asks the prover to provide the value of f(x). If this value matches an element in the set, the proof is valid.
2. Permutation Argument
* Technical Principle
    * Permutation argument is used to verify whether two lists are permutations of each other, i.e., they have the same elements but in different orders.
    * Halo2 achieves this through polynomial commitments and permutation index polynomials:
        1. Polynomial Commitment: Encode the two lists as polynomials f(x) and g(x), and generate commitments.
        2. Permutation Index: Construct a permutation index polynomial σ(x) representing the correspondence of elements in the two lists.
        3. Verification Constraint: The verifier checks whether f(x) = g(σ(x)) holds, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence of elements.
* Implementation Optimization
    * Recursive Permutation: Supports permutation verification for nested lists, such as verifying the correctness of transaction order in smart contracts.
    * Random Challenge: Introduce random numbers β and γ to reduce the probability of forged proofs (based on the Schwartz-Zippel theorem).
* Application Scenarios
    * Blockchain transaction ordering verification.
    * Data integrity verification (such as file shard recombination in distributed storage).
3. Fade Argument
* Technical Principle
    * Fade argument is used to verify that a value gradually decreases or changes over time or steps, such as installment payments or decreasing supply. 
    * Halo2 achieves this through the Vanishing Polynomial:
        1. Polynomial Construction: Encode the fading process as a polynomial h(x), where x represents time or steps.
        2. Vanishing Constraint: Construct a vanishing polynomial Z(x), whose roots correspond to the end conditions of the fading process (e.g., Z(x) = x - T, where T is the deadline).
        3. Verification Condition: The prover must prove that h(x) = 0 holds at the root of Z(x), i.e., h(T) = 0.
* Implementation Optimization
    * Recursive Vanishing: Supports nested verification of multiple fading processes, such as verifying whether each stage’s payment is compliant in multi-stage smart contracts.
    * Timestamp Binding: Associate the polynomial with a timestamp to ensure the fading process is tamper-proof.
* Application Scenarios
    * Installment payment contract verification.
    * Dynamic supply models (such as the linear release of tokens).
4. Inner Product Argument
* Technical Principle
    * Inner product argument is used to verify that the inner product of two vectors equals a certain value without exposing the specific content of the vectors. 
    * Halo2 achieves this based on the Inner Product Commitment:
        1. Vector Encoding: Encode the vectors a = [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ] and b = [b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ] as polynomials $A(x) = a₁ + a₂ x + ... + aₙ x^{n-1}$ and $B(x) = b₁ + b₂ x + ... + bₙ x^{n-1}$.
        2. Inner Product Calculation: Calculate the inner product c = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + ... + aₙbₙ, and construct the polynomial C(x) = c.
        3. Commitment Verification: The verifier checks whether $A(x) · B(x) ≡ C(x) mod (x^n - 1)$ holds, where · denotes polynomial multiplication.
* Implementation Optimization
    * Fast Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT): Utilize NTT to accelerate polynomial multiplication, reducing the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n).
    * Recursive Inner Product: Supports inner product verification for multiple vectors, such as verifying the inner product of inputs and weights in machine learning model inference.
* Application Scenarios
    * Privacy-preserving machine learning model inference.
    * Data aggregation in secure multi-party computation.
5. Multi-point Opening Argument
* Technical Principle
    * Multi-point opening argument allows verifying the values of a polynomial at multiple points simultaneously, improving the efficiency of batch verification. 
    * Halo2 achieves this through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and polynomial grouping:
        1. Polynomial Decomposition: Decompose the polynomial f(x) into multiple sub-polynomials f₁(x), f₂(x), ..., fₖ(x), each corresponding to a different set of points.
        2. Multi-point Evaluation: Evaluate each sub-polynomial on its corresponding set of points to generate a list of evaluation values.
        3. Commitment Verification: The verifier checks whether all evaluation values are consistent with the polynomial commitment, ensuring the correctness of the polynomial at all points.
* Implementation Optimization
    * Parallel Computation: Use multi-core processors to process the evaluation of multiple point sets in parallel, reducing proof generation time.
    * Compressed Encoding: Compress evaluation values into hash values, reducing the proof size (e.g., from O(n) to O(log n)).
