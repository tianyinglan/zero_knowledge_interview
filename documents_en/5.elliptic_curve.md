# some concepts about elliptic curve

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): Elliptic curves can be parameterized using elliptic functions. In ECC, points defined by the elliptic curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ (over a finite field) form an Abelian group. Using the addition formula of elliptic functions, addition and scalar multiplication operations for points on the elliptic curve are enabled. These operations serve as the foundation for ECC encryption, digital signature algorithms, etc. For instance, in the ECC Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), point operations on elliptic curves are utilized to generate and verify signatures.



## Abelian Group  

###  1. Definition  
An Abelian group (also known as a commutative group) is a group that satisfies the commutative law. Specifically, let the binary operation on the set $G$ be $+$. If the following conditions are met, then $(G, +)$ is an Abelian group:  

1. **Closure**: For any $a, b \in G$, we have $a + b \in G$.  
2. **Associativity**: For any $a, b, c \in G$, we have $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.  
3. **Identity Element**: There exists a unique element $e \in G$, such that for any $a \in G$, $a + e = e + a = a$.  
4. **Inverse Element**: For any $a \in G$, there exists a unique element $-a \in G$, such that $a + (-a) = e$.  
5. **Commutativity**: For any $a, b \in G$, we have $a + b = b + a$


## Bilinear Pairing Technical Points  

### 1. Definition and Basic Concepts  
Bilinear pairing is a mapping $e: G_1 \times G_2 \to G_T$, where $G_1, G_2$ are two cyclic groups, $G_T$ is another cyclic group, and satisfies the following three properties:  

- **Bilinearity**: For any $P_1, Q_1 \in G_1$, $P_2, Q_2 \in G_2$ and $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, there is $e(aP_1, bP_2) = e(P_1, P_2)^{ab}$.  
- **Non-degeneracy**: There exist $P \in G_1$ and $Q \in G_2$ such that $e(P, Q) \neq 1_{G_T}$, where $1_{G_T}$ is the identity element of $G_T$.  
- **Computability**: For any $P \in G_1$ and $Q \in G_2$, $e(P, Q)$ can be computed in polynomial time.  

### 2. Common Bilinear Pairings  
- **Weil Pairing**: Initially defined on the group of rational points on an elliptic curve, it is a classic bilinear pairing. Weil pairing played an important role in the early research of elliptic curve cryptography. It has good mathematical properties, but the computational complexity is relatively high.  
- **Tate Pairing**: Also a bilinear pairing defined on elliptic curves, it has improved computational efficiency compared to Weil pairing. After some modifications (such as twisted Tate pairing), it is more common in practical applications.
