PCS (Polynomial commitment schemes)
1. One open point: 
If f(x)−a is divisible by x−z, it demonstrates that f(z)=a.
2. Multi open points: 
For the set $S^+$, there exists a polynomial $Z_S(X) = \prod_{z \in S} (X - z)$. If f(X)−r(X) is divisible by the polynomial $Z_s(X)$, it means that for any element z in the set S, f(z)=r(z) holds.
3. PCS protocol
A polynomial commitment scheme should be composed of three parts, Θ=(gen,com,open), satisfying:
① gen(d) – outputs the SRS (structured reference string).
② com(f,srs)– the commitment algorithm. Given the polynomial $f \in F_{<d} [X]$ and the SRS, it calculates the commitment cm for the polynomial f.
③ open– a public coin protocol between the Prover and the Verifier.

## Polynomial Commitment Process  

### Commitment Generation  
- The prover possesses a polynomial  P(X). When using KZG, the prover converts the polynomial  P(X) into a set of points on an elliptic curve based on elements in the CRS (Common Reference String) or SRS (Structured Reference String).  
- The prover commits the polynomial  P(X)  to the elliptic curve group by computing $ [P(\tau)]_1 $ and $ [P(\tau)]_2 $ (where $ \tau $ is a secret element in the CRS or SRS). These two elements are generally referred to as the polynomial commitment.  

### Proof Generation  
- For proving the value $ P(z) $ of the polynomial $ P(X) $ at a specific point $ z $, the prover calculates the quotient polynomial $ Q(X) = \frac{P(X) - P(z)}{X - z} $.  
- The prover generates the proof $ \pi $, which represents $ Q(\tau) $ on the elliptic curve. This proof is concise, typically containing only one or several elements of the elliptic curve group.  

### Proof Verification  
- The verifier uses the commitment $ [P(\tau)]_1 $, $ [P(\tau)]_2 $, the proof $ \pi $, and the point $ z $ and $ P(z) $.  
- The verifier leverages the pairing operation of the elliptic curve and elements in the CRS or SRS to check whether the equation $ e\left([P(\tau)]_1 - [P(z)]_1, g_2\right) = e\left(\pi, [\tau - z]_2\right) $ holds (where $ e $ is the pairing function of the elliptic curve, and $ g_2 $ is the generator of the elliptic curve group). If the equation holds, the verification succeeds.  





### summary
The core of PCS is to generate a commitment. Through this commitment, the prover convinces the verifier of the existence of a certain polynomial. Common PCSs include KZG, BLS, etc., which are based on elliptic curve pairing.





# piop
IOP is a general interactive proof protocol, while PIOP is specifically designed for polynomial-related verification. In PIOP, through multiple rounds of interaction, the verifier randomly selects points and asks the prover to provide the values of the polynomial at these points, thereby verifying whether the polynomial meets the conditions such as low degree.
* Core Functions of PIOP
    * Recursive Verification: Decompose high-degree polynomials into low-degree sub - polynomials and conduct challenges round by round.
    * Low - Degree Test: Utilize the error - correction ability of Reed - Solomon codes to ensure that the degree of the polynomial is below the threshold.
* Technical Principles of PIOP
    * Random Challenge: The verifier selects a point z and asks the prover to provide f(z) and its derivative f’(z).
    * Multilinear Extension: Convert non - polynomial functions into polynomial forms for easy verification.
    * Number of Interaction Rounds: The number of rounds is proportional to the logarithm of the polynomial degree, and the verification complexity is O(logd).
* Typical Protocols of PIOP
    * SumCheck: Verify the correctness of polynomial summation by recursively fixing variables and conducting random challenges.
* Fast Reed - Solomon IOP of Proximity (FRI): Recursively fold polynomials and combine with Merkle tree commitments, supporting transparent setup.

| **Interactivity**| Non-interactive (via Fiat-Shamir) | Interactive (multi-round challenges) |
| **Proof Size**   | Compact (e.g., KZG: 300 bytes)   | Larger (e.g., FRI: 10-100KB)      |
| **Verification Time** | Constant time (depends on pairing operations) | Linear in rounds (e.g., $O(\log d)$) |

| **IP (Interactive Proof)**           | The prover and verifier interact in multiple rounds. The prover proves the statement’s correctness to the verifier, and the verifier decides whether to accept based on the responses. |
| **PCP (Probabilistically Checkable Proof)** | The verifier randomly samples parts of the proof for inspection, judging the proof’s correctness with high probability. |
| **IOP (Interactive Oracle Proof)**  | Combines the interactive features of IP and the random-checking characteristics of PCP. The verifier interacts with an oracle to obtain information for verifying the statement. |
| **PIOP (Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proof)** | A subclass of IOP, used to verify polynomial-related statements. The verifier randomly challenges polynomial points, and the prover provides values to determine polynomial properties. |
