# self-introduction
I am an experienced software engineer with 10 years of professional experience, including 3+ years specializing in zero-knowledge proof (ZK) systems, and I am excited to explore opportunities where I can contribute my expertise to cutting-edge privacy and security solutions.

As a proficient professional with a solid foundation in mathematics, computer science, and blockchain technology, my background is rich with expertise and achievements. I have honed my skills through postgraduate studies, which augmented my mathematical acumen and cross-disciplinary prowess in computer science. My exploration into zk blockchain technology has led me to significant advancements, including reducing zkEVM proof times from 1 hour to 6 minutes and optimizing data availability. I excel in zk-rollup's Rust programming, utilizing cuda ntt and msm pippenger algorithm to achieve optimization. 

My experiences in big data and machine learning have refined my expertise, I‘m proficient in machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, K-Means, LDA), applied to optimize ad bidding strategies and user behavior analysis.This making me an ideal candidate for a web3 enterprise looking for a zk Rust engineer(zkml) poised to drive blockchain innovation.

# Key Qualifications
